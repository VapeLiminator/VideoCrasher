# VideoCrasher
Just a batch file to make discord videos crash once opened.

# How do I use it?

The program itself guides you into making your own crash video.

# REMEMBER! Everytime you want to open it, please open the "VideoCrasher.exe"
## This will make the auto-updater run everytime you open the program.

# If you are using the open-soruce, please DON'T FORGET TO OPEN "VIDEOCRASHER.EXE" WITH "UWU.EXE" IN THE SAME FOLDER!
# IF NOT, IT WILL **NOT WORK**
